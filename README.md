# ASCII Art Shader

ASCII Art Shader is a Minecraft shader that renders the world as ASCII art.

This shader is based on [Chocapic13's Lite shader pack V3](http://shadersmods.com/chocapic13s-shaders-mod/) and on [movAX13h's ASCII art GLSL shader](https://blog.thrill-project.com/ascii-art-shader/) which has been highly modified to work on Minecraft.

My work is only in the `final.fsh` file.


## Installation

You need a shaders mod to use custom shaders in Minecraft. You can install [Optifine HD](http://shadersmods.com/optifine-hd-mod/) for your favorite Minecraft version.

Then place the [ASCII-Art-Shader-1.0.zip](https://github.com/Cyxo/ASCII-Art-Shader/archive/1.0.zip) under the `shaderpacks` directory in your `.minecraft` folder.

Finally, enable it in Options > Video Settings > Shaders.
